Hello my name is Shelbe, Have been interested in PC's and how they function since the age of 7, recently I got hurt at work and Got a high end pc and started my journey again. I got a chance to learn a bit of python through a friend in the industry. I enjoy working on Automotives, have been drifting as a hobbie and building since 2006. Spent 13 years installing electronics on vehicles and using computers to control them, learned to love troubleshooting. I enjoy spending hours on google learning new tasks.
